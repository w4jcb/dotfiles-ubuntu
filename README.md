My Dot Files

These are config files I use for my systems. (This is a work in progress)

Installation of dotfiles and symbolic links
git clone https://github.com/w4jcb/dotfiles.git

$ cd ~/dotfiles

$ mv install.sh ~/bin/install.sh

$ cd ~/bin

$ chmod +x install.sh


Installation of Vundle

git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

Donâ€™t forget to install Vundle or other plugins that are in the .vimrc file - :PluginInstall.
