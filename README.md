My Dot Files

These are config files I use for my systems. (This is a work in progress)

Installation of dotfiles, symbolic links and all the programs I use.

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w4jcb/dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash

Requirements for dotfiles to run => git, gdebi pip3


Also with Ubuntu 20.04 you will need..
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
