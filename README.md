My Dot Files

These are config files I use for my systems. (This is a work in progress)

Installation
git clone https://github.com/w4jcb/dotfiles.git

$ cd ~/dotfiles

$ mv install.sh ~/bin/install.sh

$ cd ~/bin

$ chmod +x install.sh

Donâ€™t forget to install the plugins in the .vimrc file - :PluginInstall.
